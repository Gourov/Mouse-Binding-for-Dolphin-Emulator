Quick Start:
	- Extract Dolphin Bundle from Zip
	- Start Dolphin
	- For TimeSplitters/NightFire/Serious Sam: Open the controller dialog and click configure, then load the controller profile for your game
	- Start Game
	- For TimeSplitters/NightFire: Load the in-game save profile titled Player
	- Run Mouse Injector.exe and press 4 in-game to toggle mouse injection

Control Layout for TimeSplitters:
	WASD - Movement
	Q - TS3 Throw grenade
	E - Activate
	R - Reload
	Left Mouse Button - Fire
	Right Mouse Button - Aim
	Mouse Wheel - Change Weapon/Zoom
	Middle Mouse Button - TS3 Melee/TS2 Alt-fire
	Control - Crouch
	T - TS3 Secondary Weapon Mode

Note:
	- For TimeSplitters: all sub-systems have yet to be supported (camera sentry, minigames, etc) - for those parts use wasd/arrow keys
	- The Mouse Injector will not work with NetPlay - it does not synchronize memory injection
	- The Mouse Injector needs to be reopened every time Dolphin is closed
	- The Mouse Injector only supports the included official Dolphin build - Ishiiruka and other versions will not work
	- Not all supported games have a pre-configured input profile - for those titles you will need to create a new profile
